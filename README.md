# AIxTech crypto intel v0.62: paper-only trading information system

Research harness for automated cryptocurrency **information** and paper strategy evaluation. Does not place live orders, does not store exchange secrets, and is not financial advice.

Builds on [zeekiankok92/aixtech-agent-harness-demo](https://github.com/zeekiankok92/aixtech-agent-harness-demo) secure AI-agent practices and prior kkzee92 versions (up to v0.61).

## Enhancements in v0.62

- Refined multi-factor strategies per asset class: adaptive EMA/ATR/Supertrend/Ichimoku/BB/Keltner/VWAP/MACD/Stochastic/Heikin-Ashi/Parabolic SAR/Donchian/GARCH-style + EWMA + realized vol + term-structure + vol-of-vol + skew-of-vol forecast proxies, Fibonacci, Elliott wave proxy, options skew/gamma/vanna/volga/charm/vanna-volga, funding-rate dynamics + basis + basis momentum + carry, expanded on-chain (volume-flow, active-address, whale, smart-money, exchange inflow/outflow, netflow, OI change, liquidation heat, order-flow imbalance, liquidity depth, MVRV, SOPR, realized-cap, exchange reserve change, NVTS proxy, Puell Multiple proxy, coin-days destroyed, age-weighted, HODL waves proxy, supply distribution, dormancy flow), DEX LP depth + IL + fee yield + impermanent loss dynamic + concentrated liquidity, volatility clustering + ATR percentile + realized vol forecast + term structure + vol-of-vol + vol skew, multi-horizon consistency, RSI/MACD/Stoch/Heikin/CCI/Williams %R/MFI/ROC/Aroon divergence, regime clustering simulation (k-means + HMM-style + GMM proxy + transition probability + LOF + DBSCAN proxy + spectral + hierarchical), volume profile/delta/POC/VAH/VAL/value area, relative strength z-score, adaptive Kelly-like + risk-parity + CVaR + max-drawdown + entropy + utility research sizing, synthetic social volume + sentiment + narrative + attention proxy.
- Portfolio-level adaptive correlation matrix + isolation risk gate with dynamic vol-scaled, forecast-adjusted, risk-parity, CVaR, Kelly, entropy, and utility proxy sizing under high vol/anomaly/correlation/isolation/cluster regimes. Added multi-asset beta, residual risk, factor exposure, and covariance shrinkage filters.
- Strengthened zero-trust cyber/data security architecture: expanded redaction (BIP39, WIF, PEM, AWS, GitHub PATs, high-entropy, Solana, session tokens, hardware wallet exports, partial seeds, quantum mentions, exchange API key patterns including Binance/Bybit/OKX/KuCoin/Gate/MEXC/Bitget/Hyperliquid formats, JWT, private key hex, Telegram/Discord bot tokens, more base58/hex variants, seed checksums, exchange-specific key formats, hardware serials, API secret fragments, ChaCha20 key mentions, SSH private keys, mnemonic phrases with checksum, encrypted wallet JSON fragments, Lightning invoice secrets, Nostr keys, passphrases, 2FA secrets), sealed multi-hash lineage (SHA-256 + SHA3-256 + BLAKE2b + SHA512 + SHA3-512 + BLAKE3 proxy + SHA3-384 + SHAKE128 proxy + SHAKE256 proxy + Blake3-like + Keccak), entropy scoring, isolation forest-style + LOF + autoencoder residual + one-class SVM proxy + DBSCAN + spectral + hierarchical anomaly, residency stamps, consecutive-action counters, source attestation, continuous verification proxies, PDPA-style tripwire, feed integrity checks, Merkle-style subtree seals with monotonic counter, quantum-safe hash mentions, continuous attestation, and data residency compliance stamps + key rotation simulation + access log simulation.
- Nine asset classes with refined playbooks, risk caps, class-specific cost models, confidence floors, and adaptive horizon. Added explicit beta, residual, factor exposure, and covariance overlays.
- Research only; synthetic fixtures recommended. AI-agent harness friendly with CI gates (lint, tests, secret scan style).

## What it does

- Classifies into nine asset classes with enhanced multi-factor research rules.
- Labels regime (trend/range/stress) + volatility tier + forecast + anomaly score + correlation regime + cluster + isolation + relative strength + risk parity + CVaR proxy + fib/elliott/options/on-chain advanced + beta/residual/factor/covariance.
- Scores signal then multi-gate risk (class caps, confidence, correlation, anomaly, isolation, drawdown, kill switch, vol scaling + forecast + risk-parity + CVaR + beta + factor + covariance).
- Paper fills with class costs; hash-chained audit with multi-hash sealed lineage.
- No live execution, no secret storage.

## Run

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
PYTHONPATH=src python -m crypto_intel.demo
PYTHONPATH=src pytest tests/ -q
```

## Controls

Paper-only mode guard. No trade keys. Class caps, confidence floors, kill switch, drawdown, correlation, anomaly, isolation, beta, factor, covariance gates. Hash-chained audit + sealed multi-hash lineage. Expanded redaction. PDPA-style tripwire. gitleaks and lint in CI recommended.

## Honesty

No live connector included. Strategy scores describe synthetic data. Not financial, legal, or compliance advice. Research only.
